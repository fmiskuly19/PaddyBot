# PaddyBot
PaddyBot is a custom built discord bot for my personal Discord server. This bot doesn't really have a single purpose; 
I just use it to cure boredom and to try new things. Most commands are suggested by my much more creative friends. I plan on either transforming this bot into a general purpose bot or porting some commands to a new bot. Currently PaddyBot is published on [discordbots.org](https://discordbots.org/bot/504543574453649408).
If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute to the bot pm me on Discord at yluksim#3735.

## Trello Board
I use this [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/4kjEoDko) to keep track of suggestions, bugs, and new ideas.

## Host
Currently the bot does not have an outward facing web component, so this [link](https://paddybot.herokuapp.com/) will inform you the application is down. It of course is not down, just not implemented yet. This will be added in a future update.
